# Sales Performance and Customer Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the Global Superstore dataset to identify key drivers of profitability and performance. The goal is to uncover actionable insights that can help a business optimize its sales and inventory strategies.

## Key Insights
* **Product Profitability:** The analysis revealed that the top 15% of products are responsible for over 80% of the company's total profit, highlighting a key group of products for strategic focus.
* **Regional Performance:** A comparative analysis showed that the East region's profit margin was nearly 10% lower than the West's, despite similar sales volumes, indicating an opportunity for operational improvement.

## Technologies Used
* **Python:** Used the Pandas library for data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.
* **SQL:** Performed data aggregation and querying to validate the analysis.
* **Tableau / Google Looker Studio:** Created an interactive dashboard to visualize key findings and performance metrics.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python and the `pandas` & `pandasql` libraries installed.
2. Clone or download the repository.
